        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>Good day! I am Ayesha Vernice Andang Yeung. 
            I was born on the 8th of March, year 2008 to
            a Chinese father and a Filipino mother. 

        </p>
        <p>Today, I was raised as a responsible 
            older sister who enjoys taking care of her siblings. 
            I have three younger siblings whos names are Austin, 
            Andre, and Atasha. We have a seemingly large age
            gap but I manage to bond with them well.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from being a scholar and an older sister, 
            I enjoy hobbies on my free time like playing 
            Roblox, soccer, volleyball, golf, playing the piano, 
            and eating yummy food. A personal favorite  of 
            mine is searching for recipes and cooking them in the 
            comfort of my own home.</p>
        <p>
            I would choose being comfortable over 
            anything else but as a responsible person, I can 
            place a time for comfort and work. I try to make 
            my work as fun as possible!  I try to be fun as 
            possible at all times.</p>
