        <h1>WHY WE CHOSE THIS TOPIC?</h1>
        <p>As a fellow citizen of todays generation, 
            I can speak for everyone when I say 
            that we like movies. From genres of action
            and adventure to comedic.

            As popular movies rise and catch our 
            interests, we stop to think of what a
            wonderful research this can make.

            From genres, to budgets, to production 
            companies to  gross sales, 
            what makes a movie a movie? And so we 
            took the effort and time to gather data 
            and analyze.
